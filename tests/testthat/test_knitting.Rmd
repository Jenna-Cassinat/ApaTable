# CorTable

This is a correlation table. It looks like this:

```{r, results='asis'}
d <- mtcars[,1:5]
corr <- furniture::tableC(d)
CorTable(
  dataset = d,
  table = corr,
  caption = "Test table with mtcars dataset"
)
```

And there you have it. That's a correlation table.

This is what texregBetter looks like:

```{r}
```
