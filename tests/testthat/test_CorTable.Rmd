# Test Correlation Table

This is a correlation table. It looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Oranges"}
d <- mtcars[,1:5]
corr <- furniture::tableC(d)
CorTable(
  dataset = d,
  table = corr,
  name = "randomId",
  caption = "Test table with mtcars dataset"
)
```

And there you have it. That's a correlation table.
